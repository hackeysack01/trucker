# Trucker Advisor (ETS2 + ATS)

Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator trucking company analyzer - optimizes trailer sets per city garage. Game-aware data pipeline; same frontend serves both games via runtime toggle.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Recommend optimal fleet of up to 5 AI drivers per city garage to maximize expected income. Supports both ETS2 (Europe) and ATS (North America); user toggles active game in the frontend.

**Core Logic**:
- Cities contain depots (company facilities), each spawning random cargo jobs
- Cargoes have value, spawn probability (prob_coef), and compatible trailer body types
- Monte Carlo simulation finds best fleet: greedy driver selection maximizing marginal EV
- City rankings use analytical E[max of N] formula for speed (no MC needed per city)

**First-Visit UX**:
- DLC configuration banner prompts new visitors to set up owned DLCs for accurate results
- Collapsible "Getting Started" onboarding section explains what the tool does and how to use it
- Collapsible "How It Works" section explains the optimization methodology
- Onboarding state (collapsed/dismissed) persisted in localStorage

## Tech Stack

**Production (GitHub Pages)**:
- **Build**: Vite (TypeScript → JavaScript bundling)
- **Static Site**: HTML/CSS + bundled JS (no backend)
- **Data**: JSON files in `/public/data/`
- **Client-Side**: TypeScript modules with fuzzy autocomplete
- **Computation**: All optimization runs in browser via Web Worker (`optimizer-worker.ts`) with async client wrapper (`optimizer-client.ts`) and synchronous fallback if Workers are unavailable
- **Theming**: Dark/light mode toggle with CSS custom properties, persisted in localStorage, no FOUC via inline script
- **Offline**: Service worker (`sw.js`) with network-first for HTML and JSON data, cache-first for CSS/JS, stale Vite bundle eviction on SW activation
- **Export**: CSV, JSON, and clipboard export from city detail view
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side city comparison (up to 5 cities) with winner highlighting, URL-addressable via `#compare=id1,id2,...` (shareable, refresh-safe)

**Development**:
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with hot reload
- **Runtime**: Node.js + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (optional, for bulk data entry only)
- **Tools**: Docker, Kysely ORM

## Data Model

**JSON Data Sources** (in `/public/data/`):
- `game-defs.json`: Authoritative game data extracted from ETS2 game files — cargo definitions (value, volume, mass, fragility, prob_coef, body_types, groups), trailer specs (body_type, volume, gross_weight_limit, chain_type, country_validity, ownable), company mappings (cargo_out/in, cities), city/country data, cargo-trailer unit counts, economy constants, truck specs, and DLC registry
- `observations.json`: Observed data from save game parsing — city-company mappings, cargo-trailer compatibility, cargo spawn frequencies, unit counts per trailer. Supplements and validates game defs but does NOT override authoritative values

**Data Loading** (`loadAllData()` in `loader.ts`):
- Loads both JSON files in parallel via fetch
- Initializes DLC registry from `game-defs.json` `dlc` section if present
- Builds entity arrays (cities, companies, cargo, trailers) from game defs as primary source, observations as fallback
- `prob_coef` (from game defs) is the authoritative spawn probability coefficient (range 0.3-2.0, most cargo at 1.0)

**Body Types**:
- 15-17 body types cover all ~359 cargo types in the game
- All trailers within a body type haul the SAME cargo set — difference is only volume/units
- Trailer tiers: Standard, Double, HCT. `trailers.ts` derives the tier from the `chain_type` field via `tierFromChainType()` (ETS2: `single`/`double`/`b_double`/`hct`; ATS: `single`/`double`/`bdouble`/`rmdouble`/`tpdouble`/`triple`). `body-types.ts` still uses ID-keyword heuristics for the `hasDoubles`/`hasBDoubles`/`hasHCT` profile flags (known gap, tracked in #250)
- Body type profiles are built dynamically from game-defs.json via `getBodyTypeProfiles()`
- Optimizer works at body-type level, not individual trailer level

**Haul Value Formula**: `unitValue × units` where `unitValue = cargo.value × (1 + 0.3×fragile + 0.3×high_value)`

**Cargo Value Bonuses**:
- Fragile cargo: +30% value bonus
- High-value cargo: +30% value bonus
- Bonuses stack (fragile + high_value = +60%)

**DLC Filtering** (`applyDLCFilter()`):
- Filters trailers by brand prefix (e.g., `feldbinder.` prefix requires Feldbinder DLC)
- Filters cargo by DLC pack or map expansion association
- Filters cities to garage-only cities not blocked by unowned map DLCs
- All browser pages apply DLC filter before displaying data

**Optional Database** (for bulk data entry):
- PostgreSQL schema mirrors JSON structure
- Export scripts generate JSON from database
- Database not needed for production deployment

## Key Algorithms

### Game Data Pipeline
1. Extract `def/` folder from ETS2 *or* ATS `.scs` archives (SCS Extractor)
2. Run `npx tsx scripts/parse-game-defs.ts /path/to/extracted/def --game <ets2|ats>` (default `ets2`)
3. Parser reads all `.sii/.sui` files: cargo, trailers, companies, cities, countries, economy, trucks
4. Computes cargo-trailer compatibility from `body_type` matching
5. Computes units per trailer: `floor(trailer_volume / cargo_volume)`, weight-limited if `gross_weight_limit` applies
6. Generates DLC registry: trailer DLCs (by brand), cargo DLCs (by pack), map DLCs (by city membership), garage cities, cargo-DLC associations
7. Outputs `public/data/<game>/game-defs.json` (e.g. `public/data/ets2/game-defs.json`, `public/data/ats/game-defs.json`) — single file per game, idempotent, includes all DLC content
8. Re-run per game on every game update or DLC — full reseed, no incremental merge needed

**Diff mode**: `npx tsx scripts/parse-game-defs.ts /path/to/def --diff --game <ets2|ats>`
- Compares freshly parsed data against existing `game-defs.json` without writing
- Reports added/removed/changed entries for cargo, trailers, companies, cities
- Useful for reviewing game updates before committing new data

### Body Type Profiles (`getBodyTypeProfiles()`)
1. Group all ownable trailers by `body_type`
2. For each body type, collect union of all compatible cargo IDs (via `trailerCargoMap`)
3. All trailers within a body type haul the SAME cargo set — difference is only volume/capacity
4. Pick best trailer per body type by total haul value across all compatible cargo
5. Detect doubles/HCT availability: `body-types.ts` still uses ID-keyword scanning (`double`/`bdouble`/`hct`) to populate `hasDoubles`/`hasBDoubles`/`hasHCT` (known gap — misses ATS `triple`/`rmdouble`/`tpdouble`, tracked in #250). For tier grouping in `trailers.ts`, use `tierFromChainType(chain_type)` instead.
6. Result: ~15-17 body types covering all ~359 cargo types

### Dominated Body Type Elimination (`findDominatedBodyTypes()`)
- Body type A is **dominated** by B if B can haul every cargo A can with >= haul value, AND B covers strictly more cargo (or has strictly higher HV somewhere)
- Dominated body types are excluded from the optimizer
- Only non-dominated body types enter the optimizer

### Depot Cargo Model (`buildCityDepotProfiles()`)
Each depot instance in a city gets a cargo profile:
```
For each company in city:
  For each depot instance (count from city_companies):
    Build cargo pool: all non-excluded cargo the company exports
    For each cargo item:
      probCoef = cargo.prob_coef (spawn probability)
      For each compatible ownable trailer valid in city's country:
        bodyHV[bodyType] = max(unitValue × units) across trailers of that body type
    Build cumulative probability distribution (CDF) for fast MC sampling
```

### Fleet Optimization — Monte Carlo Simulation (`computeOptimalFleet()`)
Constants: `MAX_DRIVERS = 5`, `MC_SIMS = 20,000`, `JOBS_PER_DEPOT = 3`

```
Phase 1 — Greedy driver selection (up to MAX_DRIVERS rounds):
  1. Pre-filter: compute analytical first-pick EV per body type, keep top 15
  2. For each pick round:
     a. Generate MC_SIMS random job boards (JOBS_PER_DEPOT jobs per depot)
     b. Simulate existing fleet on each board (drivers pick best job, remove it)
     c. For each candidate body type, measure marginal EV on remaining boards
     d. Pick body type with highest average marginal EV
     e. Add to fleet

Phase 2 — Per-driver EV computation:
  Simulate final fleet across MC_SIMS boards to get each driver's EV

Phase 3 — Collapse:
  Group drivers by body type, output count and EV per group
```

### City Ranking Score (`calculateCityRankings()`)
- Uses analytical E[max of N] formula (`analyticalFirstPickEV()`) — no MC needed
- For each non-dominated body type: compute expected value of the best job across all depots
- `score = sum of top RANKING_DRIVERS (5) body type EVs`
- Cities ranked by score descending

### Analytical E[max of N] (`analyticalFirstPickEV()`)
Multi-depot formula for ranking speed:
```
P(max across all depots ≤ H) = Π_d CDF_d(H)^JOBS_PER_DEPOT
E[max] = Σ_i hv_i × [P(max ≤ hv_i) - P(max ≤ hv_{i-1})]
```
This gives the expected value of the single best job a driver with a given body type would find.

## DLC System

Three categories of DLC content affect optimization results:

**Trailer Brand DLCs** (8 brands): Feldbinder, Kassbohrer, Kogel, Krone, Schmitz Cargobull, Schwarzmuller, Tirsan, Wielton
- Trailer ID prefix determines brand (e.g., `feldbinder.` trailers require Feldbinder DLC)
- Base game trailers use `scs.` prefix and are always available

**Cargo Pack DLCs** (9 packs): High Power Cargo, Heavy Cargo, Special Transport, Volvo Construction, JCB Equipment, Bobcat Cargo, KRONE Agriculture, Farm Machinery, Forest Machinery
- Each pack adds specific cargo IDs to the game
- Cargo-DLC mapping maintained in `CARGO_DLC_MAP` in `dlc-data.ts`

**Map Expansion DLCs** (9 maps): Going East!, Scandinavia, Vive la France!, Italia, Beyond the Baltic Sea, Road to the Black Sea, Iberia, West Balkans, Greece
- Each map adds cities (tracked in `CITY_DLC_MAP`)
- Maps also add "shadow cargo" — cargo types that only appear with the map DLC (tracked in `MAP_DLC_CARGO`)
- `GARAGE_CITIES` set tracks which cities have purchasable garages

### ATS DLC Coverage

- **Brand DLCs (ATS)**: enumerated in `ATS_TRAILER_DLCS` (`scripts/parse-game-defs.ts`); ATS uses brand-prefix matching identical to ETS2.
- **Map expansion DLCs (ATS)**: each US state shipped as a separate DLC. Mapping lives in `ATS_STATE_TO_DLC` (`Record<stateCode, string[]>`). City→DLC map built dynamically by `buildAtsCityDlcMap(cities)` from each city's `country` (state code) field — no hand-curated `ATS_CITY_DLC_MAP`.
- **Garage cities (ATS)**: enumerated in `ATS_GARAGE_CITIES`. SCS internal IDs follow a 12-char truncation rule with documented per-city exceptions (`salt_lake`, asymmetric `texarkana` / `texarkana_ar`, symmetric `kansas_ci_ks` / `kansas_ci_mo`); see comment block above `ATS_GARAGE_CITIES`.
- **Cargo pack DLCs (ATS)**: `ATS_CARGO_DLC_MAP` and `ATS_MAP_DLC_CARGO` are intentional empty stubs — not yet populated. Affects only the marginal-value DLC calculator for ATS cargo. Tracked as known gap in PR #242.

**DLC Filtering Pipeline**:
1. User toggles DLC ownership on the DLCs page (stored in localStorage)
2. On page load, `applyDLCFilter()` removes unowned trailers, cargo, and cities
3. All pages (rankings, city detail, browsers) operate on filtered data

**Marginal Value Calculator** (`dlc-value.ts`):
- For each unowned DLC, computes the fleet EV delta if the player owned it
- Uses analytical city rankings (fast) — evaluates each DLC by adding it hypothetically and re-ranking
- Map DLCs show both "shadow cargo" improvement at existing garages and potential new garage cities
- Results sorted by total EV delta descending

**DLC Data Initialization**:
- Hardcoded fallbacks in `dlc-data.ts` used until game-defs.json loads
- `initDlcData()` overrides with live data from `game-defs.json` `dlc` section
- DLC registry generated by `parse-game-defs.ts` from game file analysis

## Commands

**Frontend Development**:
```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run dev:frontend     # Start Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build:frontend   # Build for production (outputs to public/dist/)
npm run preview          # Preview production build locally
npm run test             # Run test suite
npm run lint             # TypeScript type checking
```

**Production Site**:
- Deployed to GitHub Pages: https://alexoq.github.io/trucker
- CI builds via `npm run build:frontend` and deploys `public/dist/` folder
- Base path: `/trucker/` (configured in vite.config.ts)

**Backend (Optional - Data Entry Only)**:
```bash
docker compose up -d     # Start PostgreSQL
npm run migrate          # Run database migrations
npm run dev              # Start Express server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run export           # Export database to JSON files
```

**Data Pipeline**:
```bash
npm run parse-saves       # Parse ETS2 save game files into observations.json (ETS2 only; ATS save parsing not implemented)
```

**Note**: Backend is only for bulk data entry. Production site runs entirely client-side from JSON files.

## Git Workflow

- Always squash-merge PRs to keep history clean

## Data Entry

Primary data source is `game-defs.json` generated by the parser. Manual data entry via the optional database is only needed for supplementary data not in game files.

### Data Entry Rules

**Skip vehicle cargoes** (not in game data):
- Campervans, Cars, Luxury SUVs, Panter, Vans, Pickups

**Excluded cargoes** (mark `excluded=true`):
- Trailer delivery jobs (Feldbinder trailers, Krone trailers) - these are "drive this trailer" type jobs with no trailer choice

**City names**:
- Use proper Unicode/diacritics (Córdoba not Cordoba, Zürich not Zurich)

## Agent Workflow System

See `docs/AGENT-WORKFLOW.md` for full details.

### State Tracking

- State file: `analysis/.state.json`
- If `analysis/` missing: run analysis agents to reconstruct state
- Phases: `analysis` → `pm-review` → `development` → `merge` → (repeat)

### Command Recognition

| User Says | Agent Action |
|-----------|--------------|
| `status` | Read state, report phase/progress/queue/openPRs |
| `run user testing` | Spawn 2 code-level agents (code analysis, no browser) → `analysis/user-testing.md` |
| `run fresh analysis` | Run all analysis agents in parallel → `analysis/*.md` |
| `perform QA work` | Pull closed issues, test local dev, output → `analysis/qa-review.md` |
| `run architect review` | Analyze codebase for major improvements → `analysis/arch-review.md` |
| `audit documentation` | Scan all sources (issues/PRs/code/docs) → `analysis/docs-review.md` |
| `analyze saves` | Parse save game files, extract observations, update game data → `analysis/save-analysis.md` |
| `PM review` | Read `analysis/*.md`, create/update GitHub issues, transition state |
| `start development` | Pull from queue, run ralph-specum spec-driven flow in worktrees |
| `merge and cleanup` | Squash-merge PRs, remove worktrees, pull main, transition to analysis |

### Agent Behaviors

**All agents**:
- Check `analysis/.state.json` on startup
- Return structured findings as text — coordinator writes to `analysis/` directory
- Do NOT attempt to write files directly (agents lack Write tool access)

**User Testing** (2 code-level agents, `voltagent-qa-sec:qa-expert`):
- 2 code-level agents with random personas from pool of 10
- Recently closed issues split evenly between the 2 agents (no overlap)
- Agent A (Dana-type): a11y, keyboard, focus, responsive CSS, mobile layout, touch targets
- Agent B (Elena-type): data accuracy, edge cases, caching, race conditions, state
- No Playwright — code-level analysis is 3x faster with same coverage

**QA** (`pr-review-toolkit:code-reviewer`):
- Target: local dev server (`npm run dev:frontend` on http://localhost:5173)
- Pulls recently closed issues via `gh issue list --state closed`
- Reviews code changes, runs tests, checks regressions

**Architect** (`ralph-specum:architect-reviewer`):
- Scope: major improvements only (framework changes, major refactors, upcoming blockers)
- Not for small fixes

**Save Analysis** (`voltagent-data-ai:data-engineer`):
- Purpose: Parse ETS2 save game files to extract observed job data and fill gaps in game-defs.json
- Input: User provides save game file paths (typically `game.sii` files)
- Scripts: Use/create scripts in `/scripts/` for parsing (e.g., `parse-saves.cjs`, `inspect-save.cjs`)
- Output: `analysis/save-analysis.md` with findings, `public/data/observations.json` updated
- Data extracted: city↔company mappings, company↔cargo mappings, cargo↔trailer compatibility, cargo unit counts per trailer, cargo spawn frequencies
- Validation: Cross-reference extracted data against `game-defs.json` to find discrepancies
- Priority data gaps: cargo_trailer_units (how many units fit per trailer — game defs compute from volume, saves confirm actual counts), new DLC cities/companies not yet in game defs
- Does NOT replace game-defs.json values — observations supplement and validate authoritative game data
- Key principle: `prob_coef` from game defs is authoritative for spawn probability; observations only used for validation and gap-filling

**Documentation** (`voltagent-dev-exp:documentation-engineer`):
- Sources: GitHub issues, PRs, comments, code, docs/
- Checks: accuracy, duplicates, staleness

**PM** (`voltagent-biz:product-manager`):
- Reads all `analysis/*.md` files
- Creates/updates GitHub issues with labels
- Labels: `priority:P0|P1|P2`, `type:bug|feature|ux`
- Manages development queue in state
- **Blocked issues**: Issues with dependencies go to `blockedIssues`, NOT `developmentQueue`
- Moves issues from `blockedIssues` → `developmentQueue` when blockers complete

**Development** (`ralph-specum` with `--quick`):
- Each issue runs in separate git worktree: `git worktree add ../trucker-<slug> -b feat/<slug>`
- `--quick` flag: skips interactive phases, auto-generates specs, executes non-interactively
- Ends with PR containing "Closes #XX" in body
- Up to 3 parallel background agents for unblocked issues (requires pre-approved permissions)
- Blocked issues wait until blocking PRs are **merged** (not just opened)

**Merge and Cleanup**:
- Squash-merge all open PRs: `gh pr merge <num> --squash --delete-branch`
- Force-remove worktrees: `git worktree remove --force <path>`
- Delete local feature branches
- Pull main with merged changes
- Clean analysis folder: delete `*.md` files (keep `.state.json`)
- Move unblocked issues from `blockedIssues` → `developmentQueue`
- Reset `analysisComplete` flags, transition to analysis
- Note: `completedThisCycle` preserved for PM, reset when PM transitions to development
